## Section 1: SDD Foundations (Lessons 1-5)

### Question 1: Vague Code Problem

**What is "vibe coding"?**

A) Writing code with good vibes and positive energy  
B) Giving AI vague prompts and hoping it "gets the vibe"  
C) Coding while listening to music  
D) Pair programming with AI

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) Giving AI vague prompts and hoping it "gets the vibe"**

Vibe coding is when you give AI ambiguous requirements and expect it to infer your intent, leading to endless iterations.
</details>

### Question 2: Cost of Vagueness

**According to the book, how much time can a 15-minute collaborative spec save compared to vague prompts?**

A) 15 minutes  
B) 30 minutes  
C) 90 minutes  
D) 3 hours

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**C) 90 minutes**

A 5-minute vague prompt + 2 hours iteration = 125 minutes  
A 15-minute spec + 30-minute implementation = 45 minutes  
Time saved: 80-90 minutes
</details>

### Question 3: AI Literal-Mindedness

**Why do AI coding assistants need clear specifications?**

A) They are lazy and don't want to think  
B) They are literal-minded and execute exactly what you specify  
C) They prefer detailed documentation  
D) They can't write code without specs

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) They are literal-minded and execute exactly what you specify**

AI doesn't infer intent like humans do—it executes literal instructions and makes assumptions when specs are vague.
</details>

### Question 4: Why NOW?

**What are the three convergent forces that made SDD viable in 2025?**

A) Better computers, faster internet, more developers  
B) AI production-readiness, proven time savings, AI literal-mindedness  
C) New programming languages, cloud computing, mobile apps  
D) Remote work, agile methodology, DevOps

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) AI production-readiness, proven time savings, AI literal-mindedness**

These three forces converged to make specifications more valuable than ever before.
</details>

### Question 5: Specification Components

**What are the four essential components of a production-ready specification?**

A) Title, Author, Date, Version  
B) Code, Tests, Documentation, Deployment  
C) Intent, Success Criteria, Constraints, Non-Goals  
D) Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**C) Intent, Success Criteria, Constraints, Non-Goals**

These four components create a complete, unambiguous specification.
</details>

### Question 6: Evals-First Principle

**What does "Evals-First" mean?**

A) Evaluate code quality after writing it  
B) Define test cases before writing code  
C) Hire evaluators to review specifications  
D) Use evaluation metrics for performance

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) Define test cases before writing code**

Evals-First means defining success criteria and tests BEFORE implementation, ensuring specifications are testable.
</details>

### Question 7: Success Criteria

**What makes good Success Criteria?**

A) Vague and flexible  
B) Specific and measurable  
C) Long and detailed  
D) Optional and suggested

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) Specific and measurable**

Success Criteria must be testable and specific enough to verify implementation correctness.
</details>

### Question 8: Non-Goals

**Why are Non-Goals important in specifications?**

A) They make specs longer  
B) They prevent scope creep and clarify boundaries  
C) They list things the developer doesn't like  
D) They are required by regulations

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) They prevent scope creep and clarify boundaries**

Non-Goals explicitly state what the feature does NOT do, preventing over-engineering and misunderstandings.
</details>

### Question 9: Collaborative Specification

**What is the benefit of collaborating with AI on specifications?**

A) AI writes the spec for you  
B) AI suggests patterns you didn't consider, you provide constraints AI doesn't know  
C) It makes the process faster  
D) AI validates your grammar

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) AI suggests patterns you didn't consider, you provide constraints AI doesn't know**

Collaboration combines AI's pattern knowledge with your domain expertise and constraints.
</details>

### Question 10: Constitutions

**What is a Constitution in SDD?**

A) A legal document for software projects  
B) Shared rules that apply to all specifications in a project  
C) The project's founding principles  
D) A governance framework for teams

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**B) Shared rules that apply to all specifications in a project**

Constitutions enforce quality standards and capture organizational learning across all specs.
</details>
